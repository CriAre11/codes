        <div class="paragraph"><h2> Interesting facts about Vapes and Cigarettes. </h2> <h3>Cigarettes</h3> expose users to over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are harmful and include known carcinogens like tar and nicotine. This exposure significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer, as well as cancers of the mouth, throat, and bladder. Nicotine is highly addictive, making it challenging for smokers to quit, and the risks extend to those around them through secondhand smoke, which can cause respiratory issues and elevate the risk of heart disease. The well-documented negative health impacts of cigarettes make them a major public health concern.
           <p> <li><b>Cancer Risk:</b></li>Cigarettes contain over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are carcinogens. Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer and is linked to cancers of the mouth, throat, and bladder.
                </p>
            <p><li><b>Addiction:</b></li>Because of the heavy ammounts of nicotine in one stick of a <b>cigarette</b> can lead to addiction, you will be prone to more harmful effects.
                </p>
           <p><li><b>Secondhand Smoke:</b></li>Breathing it in can lead to serious health problems, like lung diseases, heart issues, and even cancer. It’s especially dangerous for kids, who can get sick more easily from it.</p>
         <h3>Vapes</h3> being relatively new, present a different set of concerns. While they don’t contain the same level of harmful chemicals as cigarettes, they often have high levels of nicotine, which can lead to addiction and affect brain development in adolescents. Additionally, the long-term health effects of vaping are not yet fully known, but there are worries about potential respiratory and cardiovascular issues. The aerosol produced by vapes may contain harmful substances like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, raising further health concerns. Despite being perceived as a less harmful alternative, vapes carry their own risks that warrant careful consideration.

    Stopping smoking isn’t easy, but hundreds of thousands of people in Aotearoa have done it, and you can too.
 
Many of us know someone who has gone ‘cold turkey’, who just decided to stop smoking one day and never smoked again. However, the reality for many people is that quitting smoking is hard, because nicotine is so addictive. Sometimes it takes lots of tries before you finally quit. Just remember that every quit attempt is bringing you one step closer to the day you can say, "I don't smoke."
