        Quitting smoking has profound effects on various aspects of life, including school and daily activities. For students, quitting can lead to improved concentration and better academic performance, as nicotine withdrawal often improves cognitive function and memory. In everyday life, non-smokers enjoy enhanced overall health, reduced risk of diseases, and greater energy levels, making it easier to engage in activities and maintain relationships. This is why I did this website because smoking never did a good thing for all the people.</h2></div>
